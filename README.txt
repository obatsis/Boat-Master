Boat Master is also a sailing yacht project.
The unit is placed inside the electronics of the boat and it is directly connected with the engine, the lights, the GPS, the auto pilot and the Master Display.
The user can control the entire sailboat through a portable controller or through his smartphone with the BoatMaster application which I also created.
